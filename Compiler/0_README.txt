In order to compile a program:

1) Run "1_create.bat" to generate .j file
2) Run "2_compile.bat" to compile the .j file into a .class file
3) Run "3_run.bat" to run the .class file

NOTES:
- File must be named "test.c" and in this directory
- 1_create.bat creates the .j then moved it to this directory
